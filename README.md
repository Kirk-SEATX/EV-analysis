# EV-analysis
Project to evaluate which EV/PHEV I should purchase.

My wife and I are thinking of purchasing another vehicle. The aim of this project is to identify the most common Electric and Partial Electric Vehicles available on Craisglist within 250 miles, and analyze which car best suits our needs, price point, and in which areas we should be looking. 

The project consists of a scaper written in Python using Requests, and analysis performed in Python with Pandas and Matplotlib.
